# Modul 1 
AI - computer vision, Natural language processing Deep learning GenAI, Machine learning
## ML
suprvised - learns by finding pattern in labled data
unsupervised - learns patterns on on unlabled data
semi-supervised - trains on labled data iterativly creates new lables
reinforced - learns form enviroment feedback

### techniques
classification - predicts class or category of a case 
regression - predict continuous values and there progression
clustering - finds similarity in groups
association - finds events that co-occur like items often bought together
anomaly detection - detects abnormal cases used in credit card fraud detection
sequence mining - predict next event
dimension reduction - reduce data size 
recommendation systems - 

### Lifecycle
* problem definition, data collection, data prep, model development and eval, model deployment
* ETL Extract Transform and Load; data collection and prep

Data prep - clean/ remove irrelevant data, 
            remove outliers, 
            handle missing values(remove or replace with random), 
            fix formats, 
            create features, 
            EDA, 
            split data into training and test sets

model dev - use existing frameworks
model eval - test on data testing set
deployment - continuous tracking of model success 


# Modul 2 Regression
* type of supervised learning 
* simple regression : a single independent var estimates a dependant one can be linear and non linear
* multiple regression: more than one independent var estimates the dependent var
