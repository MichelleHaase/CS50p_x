# intro
Supervised learning Problem
* outcome measurement (y) == dependent Variable == response == target    
* predictor measurements (x) == inputs = regressors == covariates == features independent Var
* regression problem y is quantitative like blood preassure 
* classification Problem y finite in an unordered set like male/ female; dead/ alive; 0-9
## supervised learning objectives
    predict test unseen cases
    understand the impact of inputs
    asses quality of predictors and inferences 
example: teaching a kid the difference between a bike and a house by showing it (labled) examples.

## unsupervised learning objectives
    no outcome var(y), just a set of predictors (features) measured on a set of samples
    finding similarities in sample behavior, feature behavior some sort od grouping 
    hard to meassure the quality
    can be used as a pre-processing step for supervised learning (picking the predictors)
* in unsupervised learning the goal is to learn from just having (unlabled) examples and for example finding common features like a house has straightlines and edges while bikes have more curves and flowing lines - group by similarities by features
